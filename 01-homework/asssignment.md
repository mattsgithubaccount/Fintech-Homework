# Marcus by Goldman Sachs

## Overview and Origin

* Goldman Sachs (Company) - Marcus (Service)


* Marcus was created by Goldman Sachs in 2016. "Marcus by Goldman Sachs" is an online-only bank that provides "high-yield personal savings accounts, high-yield certificates of deposit, and no fee personal loans." Marcus is named after Marcus Goldman, who founded Goldman Sachs in 1869. Marcus, the service, was designed to meet the needs of the commmon consumer. As of 2020, 87% of Goldman's net revenue came from sources outside of the "consumer & wealth management" segment, so Marcus provides a previously (and relatively) untapped source of income. As of 2020 (according to CNBC), Adam Dell, a partner at Goldman, is head of product at Marcus. Dell is "an entrepeneuer and brother of billionaire Michael Dell, [and] came to Goldman in 2018 after selling a start-up called Clarity Money to the bank for $100 million."


## Business Activities:


* The intended customer of Marcus is the common consumer. Marcus is best for consumers who "want a higher-than average savings and CD rate, need a savings account with no minimum deposit, are looking for flexibility in their CDs, want a savings account that is difficult to access, need a personal loan with no fees and a fixed rate, do not need a bank to handle all of their account needs, or want a bank with an established institution with a long history." As of 2021, Marcus had over $100 billion in deposits. Marcus has "eight million customers...nearly $10 billion in card and loan balances [and] $1.5 billion in run rate revenue."


## Landscape:

* Marcus by Goldman Sachs is in the consumer banking domain. Goldman's entry into consumer banking diverges from their traditional role as an investment bank and their reputation for serving only "well-heeled" clients.

* The consumer banking industry has changed drastically over the past 5-10 and rapidly with the growth of "FinTech." For example, consumer banks and consumer banking apps are able to offer consumers services twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, which is vastly different from the days when one could only access their services during business hours. This trend is especially true with mobile technology as opposed to desktop computers. Additionally, FinTech companies have "developed narrowly defined, but highly effective solutions" to compete with traditional financial services companies.

* Marcus competes with "mobile banks such as Chime, Square's Cash App, fee free brokerage Robinhood and the digital offerings from megabanks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America."


## Recommendations

* One thing that would be useful for Marcus to offer that it currently does not is mobile check deposits. The problem, specifically, as Source 4 states, is that "[the bank] does not allow for mobile check deposit. If you need to make a deposit into your high-yield savings account, you will have to mail a paper check, make a transfer from a linked external bank account, set up a direct deposit, or effectuate a wire transfer."

* A mobile check deposit option service would benefit Marcus because according to Source 5 and a 2021 report "70% of consumers surveyed say mobile deposit is a banking feautre they prioritize when looking for a bank."

* The technology that Marcus would need to utilize to allow mobile check deposits is known as "remote deposit capture." As Source 6 indicates, "to use remote deposit capture, a bank customer endorses the check with a signature and the phrase 'for deposit only,' photographs or scanned images of the check's front and back, and submits it electronically to the bank over the Internet or a cellular network using a computer of smartphone."
